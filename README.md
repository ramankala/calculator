Building a calcultor web application that has a responsive gui.  The user can click the buttons on the calculator in order to apply operators on any two values a user wishes.  This project will tie together my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

Version 1
[x] Create add function.
[x] Create subtract function.
[x] Create multiply function.
[x] Create divide function.
[x] Create operate button.

Version 2
[x] Create basic HTML calculator, each button should have a digit and operator, and equals key.
[x] Create functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.

Version 3
[x] Make the Calculator work.

Version 4
[x] Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer.

This final project in the Foundations track of the Odin Project has tied together everything I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It pushed what I knew thus far into making this project which was not as simple as it seems.  The JavaScript logic gave me some difficulty in applying multiple operations, for example "12+7-5*3".  To use this application is simple, it functions the same way as a regular calculator and performs the same functions.
